## Project Description
This project is developed to extract the useful information from the raw data of an e-commerce organization to figure out from which age group of customer's belongs to which which state with what marital status and from which working sector are the highest buyers so that the organization can make informed decision's about their inventory management, product portfolio etc in the future. 
(Provide more detailed overview of the project.  Talk a bit about your data sources and what questions and hypothesis you are exploring. What specific data analysis/visualization and modelling work are you using to solve the problem? What blockers and challenges are you facing?  Feel free to number or bullet point things here)

## Needs of this project

- data exploration/descriptive statistics
- data processing/cleaning
- statistical modeling
- writeup/reporting
- etc. (be as specific as possible)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept [here](Repo folder containing raw data) within this repo.

    *If using offline data mention that and how they may obtain the data from the froup)*
    
3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](Repo folder containing data processing scripts/notebooks)
4. etc...

*If your project is well underway and setup is fairly complicated (ie. requires installation of many packages) create another "setup.md" file and link to it here*  

5. Follow setup [instructions](Link to file)
